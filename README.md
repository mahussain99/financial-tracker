# Project Title: Financial Tracker

## Description of the Project

The Accounting Ledger is a Java-based console application that allows users to manage and track their financial transactions in a simple, organized format. Users can add deposits and payments, review a complete ledger of past transactions, and generate custom reports based on dates or vendors. Each transaction is recorded with the date, time, description, vendor, and amount, and stored in a local file (transactions.csv) for long-term tracking.
